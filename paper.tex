NEEDS TO BE UPDATED!
Model-order reduction is a common way to efficiently investigate the dynamic behavior of complex structures and machines in real world applications. % or even in real-time.
%
Recently, a novel approach denoted as a generalized component mode synthesis (GCMS) has been developed, which is based on a modal reduction for moving and rotating flexible bodies. 
The defining property of GCMS is a linear configuration space, which is obtained at the expense of a larger set of coordinates. % compared to the conventional floating frame of reference formulation (FFRF) based component mode synthesis (CMS). 
The simple and uniform structure of the equations of motion, which is built upon a specific co-rotational strain measure, leads to linear inertia terms and allows, e.g., a straight-forward application of energy-momentum consistent time-integration schemes.
%

A conceptually different approach for the modelling of rigid and flexible multibody dynamics systems is the global modal parameterization (GMP). In this method, the global motion and deformation of several bodies is interpolated by a set of global shape functions that may change over time.
Specific formulations of GMP attempt to achieve a computationally efficient representation as well as an optimal interpolation of such time varying global shape functions.
%
In order to construct a global modal parameterization, a constraint reduction is typically performed. 
As a consequence, strongly nonlinear terms occur in the equations of motion and, in particular, the non-constant mass matrix and gyroscopic terms entail significant computational costs. 
Not least for these reasons, it is beneficial to have a constant reduction space providing a constant reduced mass-matrix, which is enabled by combining the fundamental ideas and advantages of the GCMS and the GMP approach. 
%
In the present paper, the fundamental ideas of GCMS and GMP are shortly reviewed, and the combined method is presented. 
A numerical example of a modally reduced flexible multibody system demonstrating the efficiency of the combined method is shown.
